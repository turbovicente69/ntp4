        <p>Aside from the rank and file legionary (who received the base wage of 10 assēs a day or 225 denarii a year), the following list describes the system of officers which developed within the legions from the Marian reforms (104 BC) until the military reforms of Diocletian (c. 290).</p>
        <h2 class = "podnaslovr">Senior officers</h2>
        <div>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Legatus Augusti pro praetore, Imperial Legate</b>: The commander of two or more legions. The Imperial Legate also served as the governor of the province in which the legions he commanded were stationed. Of Senatorial rank, the Imperial Legate was appointed by the Emperor and usually held command for 3 or 4 years. In the present time, an Imperial Legate would be called a General.</li>
                <li><b>Legatus legionis, Legion Legate</b>: The overall legion commander. The post was usually filled by a senator, appointed by the emperor, who held command for 3 or 4 years, although he could serve for a much longer period. In a Roman province with only one legion, the legatus was also the provincial governor. In such circumstances, the Legatus was dual-hatted as both Legion Legate and Imperial Legate. The Legion Legate also served as commander of the auxiliary units attached to the legion though they were not formally a part of the legion’s command structure.</li>
                <li><b>Tribunus laticlavius, Broad Band Tribune</b>: Named for the broad striped tunic worn by men of senatorial rank, this tribune was appointed by the emperor or the Senate. Though generally young, he was more experienced than the tribuni angusticlavii, he served as second in command of the legion, behind the legate. Because of his age and inexperience he was not the actual second in command in battle, but if the legate died he would take command of the legion.</li>
                <li><b>Praefectus castrorum, Camp Prefect</b>: The Camp Prefect was third in command of the legion. Generally he was a long serving veteran from a lower social status than the tribunii whom he outranked, and who previously had served as primus pilus and finished his 25 years with the legions. He was used as a senior officer in charge of training a legion, though he could also command a cohort of auxiliaires.</li>
                <li><b>Tribuni angusticlavii, Narrow Band Tribunes</b>: Each legion had five lower ranking tribunes, who were normally from the equestrian class and had at least some years of prior military experience. They often served the role of administrative officers. This tribunate was often a first, but optional, step in a young man’s political career.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2 class = "podnaslovr">Centurions</h2>
            <p>The rank of centurion was an officer grade that included many ranks, meaning centurions had very good prospects for promotion. The most senior centurion in a legion was known as the primus pilus (first file or spear), who directly commanded the first century of the first cohort and commanded the whole first cohort when in battle. Within the second to tenth cohorts, the commander of each cohort’s first century was known as a pilus prior and was in command of his entire cohort when in battle. The seniority of the pilus prior centurions was followed by the five other century commanders of the first cohort, who were known as primi ordines.</p>
            <p>The six centuries of a normal cohort, were, in order of precedence:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The forward hastati (forward spears)</li>
                <li>The rear hastati (rear spears)</li>
                <li>The forward principes (forward principal line)</li>
                <li>The rear principes (rear principal line)</li>
                <li>The forward triarii (forward third line)</li>
                <li>The rear triarii (rear third line)</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The centuries took their titles from the old use of the legion drawn up in three lines of battle using three classes of soldier. (Each century would then hold a cross-section of this theoretical line, although these century titles were now essentially nominal.) Each of the three lines is then sub-divided within the century into a more forward and a more rear century.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Primus pilus</b>, literally <b>First File</b>: The Primus Pilus was the commanding centurion of the first century, first cohort and the senior-most centurion of the entire legion. (Unlike other cohorts, the first cohort had only one javelin century, instead of a “front spear” and a “back spear” century.) The primus pilus had a chance of later becoming a Praefectus Castrorum. When the primus pilus retired, he would most likely gain entry into the equestrian class. He was paid 60 times the base wage. Primus Pilus were also paid more than an average centurion and like a narrowband tribune.</li>
                <li>Pilus prior: The “front file” centurions were the commanders of the 10 1st centuries within the legion, making them senior centurions of their respective cohorts. While the legion was in battle formation, the Pilus Prior was given command of their entire cohort. The Primus Pilus was also a Pilus Prior, and the most senior of all the centurions within the legion. These positions were usually held by experienced veteran soldiers who had been moved up within the ranks. This rank is subordinate to the Primus Pilus.</li>
                <li>Primi ordines: The “ranks of the first [cohort]” were the five centurions of the first cohort, and included the primus pilus. They, excluding the primus pilus, were paid 30 times the base wage. This rank is senior to all other centurions, save the primus pilus and pilus prior.</li>
                <li>Other centurions: Each legion had 59 or 60 centurions, one to command each century of the 10 cohorts. They were the backbone of the professional army and were the career soldiers who ran the day-to-day life of the soldiers and issued commands in the field. They were generally moved up from the ranks, but in some cases could be direct appointments from the emperor or other higher-ranking officials. The cohorts were ranked from the first to the tenth and the century within each cohort ranked from 1 to 6, with only five centuries in the first cohort (for a total of 59 centurions and the primus pilus). The century that each centurion commanded was a direct reflection of his rank: command of the 1st century of the first cohort was the highest, and the 6th century of the 10th cohort was the lowest. Paid ten times the basic wage.</li>

        <h2 class = "podnaslovr">Lower ranks</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Optio: One for each centurion (59–60), they were appointed by the centurion from within the ranks to act as his second in command and were paid twice the basic wage. Equivalent to a modern First Sergeant.</li>
            <li>Tesserarius: (Guard commander) One for each century. They acted as seconds to the Optios and were paid one and a half times the basic wage. Keeper of the watchword, administrative assistant to HQ Staff, third in command of a century. These men fought as normal soldiers when the century they were attached to was not in the vanguard. Equivalent to a modern Staff Sergeant.</li>
            <li>Decurion: Commanded a cavalry unit (turma) of 10 to 30 eques legionis.</li>
            <li>Decanus: Commanded a contubernium or ten men tent party, eight soldiers and two non-combatants, equivalent to a Sergeant or Corporal. A group of four soldiers would be referred to as a Quaternion.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class = "podnaslovr">Special duty posts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Aquilifer: A single position within the legion. The aquilifer was the legion’s standard– or Aquila (eagle)– bearer and was an enormously important and prestigious position. Losing the aquila was considered the greatest dishonor a legion could endure. This post therefore had to be filled with steady veteran soldiers, with an excellent understanding of the tactics of the legion. He was paid twice the basic wage.</li>
            <li>Signifer: Each century had a signifer (thus, there were 59 in a legion) and within each cohort the 1st century’s signifer would be the senior. He was standard-bearer for the centurial signum, a spear shaft decorated with medallions and topped with an open hand to signify loyalty, which was a rallying point for the soldiers. In addition to carrying the signum, the signifer also assumed responsibility for the financial administration of the unit and functioned as the legionaries’ banker. He was paid twice the basic wage.</li>
            <li>Cornicen (Horn blower): Worked hand in hand with the signifer drawing the attention of the men to the centurial signum and issuing the audible commands of the officers. He was paid twice the basic wage.</li>
            <li>Imaginifer: A special position from the time of Augustus onwards. Carried the standard bearing the image of the Emperor as a constant reminder of the troops’ loyalty to him. He was paid twice the basic wage.</li>
            <li>Immunes: Immunes were legionary soldiers who possessed specialized skills, qualifying them for better pay and excusing them from labour and guard work. Engineers, artillerymen, musicians, clerks, quartermasters, drill and weapons instructors, carpenters, hunters, medical staff and military police were all immune soldiers. These men were still fully trained legionaries, however, and were called upon to serve in the battle lines when needed.</li>
            <li>Evocatus: A veteran of the Roman army who had earned his military diploma for military service, but had chosen to re-enlist. They received double pay and were excluded from regular duties, such as manual labour.</li>
            <li>Duplicarius: A special pay grade that could also be awarded regardless of rank, received double the basic pay.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class = "podnaslovr">Pay</h2>
        <p>From the time of Gaius Marius onwards, legionaries received 225 denarii a year (equal to 900 Sestertii); this basic rate remained unchanged until Domitian, who increased it to 300 denarii. In spite of the steady inflation during the 2nd century, there was no further rise until the time of Septimius Severus, who increased it to 500 denarii a year. However, the soldiers did not receive all the money in cash, as the state deducted a clothing and food tax from their pay. To this wage, a legionary on active campaign would hope to add the booty of war, from the bodies of their enemies and as plunder from enemy settlements. Slaves could also be claimed from the prisoners of war and divided amongst the legion for later sale, which would bring in a sizeable supplement to their regular pay.</p>
        <p>All legionary soldiers would also receive a praemia (veterans’ benefits) on completion of their term of service of 25 years or more: a sizeable sum of money (3,000 denarii from the time of Augustus) and/or a plot of good farmland (good land was in much demand); farmland given to veterans often helped in establishing control of the frontier regions and over rebellious provinces. Later, under Caracalla, the praemia increased to 5,000 denarii.</p>

        <h2 class = "podnaslovr">Discipline</h2>
        <p>The military discipline of the legions was quite harsh. Regulations were strictly enforced, and a broad array of punishments could be inflicted upon a legionary who broke them. Many legionaries became devotees in the cult of the minor goddess Disciplina, whose virtues of frugality, severity and loyalty were central to their code of conduct and way of life.</p>
        <h2 class = "podnaslovr">Minor punishments</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Castigatio – being hit by the centurion with his staff or animadversio fustium (Tac. Annals I, 23)</li>
            <li>Reduction of rations or to be forced to eat barley instead of the usual grain ration</li>
            <li>Pecuniaria mulcta – Reduction in pay, fines or deductions from the pay allowance</li>
            <li>Flogging in front of the century, cohort or legion</li>
            <li>Whipping with the flagrum (flagellum, flagella), or “short whip” – a much more brutal punishment than simple flogging. The “short whip” was used by slave volunteers, volones, who constituted the majority of the army in the later years of the Roman Empire.</li>
            <li>Gradus deiectio – Reduction in rank</li>
            <li>Missio ignominiosa – Dishonourable discharge</li>
            <li> Loss of time in service advantages</li>
            <li>Militiae mutatio – Relegation to inferior service or duties.</li>
            <li>Munerum indictio – Additional duties</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class = "podnaslovr">Major Punishments</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Fustuarium – a sentence for desertion or dereliction of duty. The legionary would be stoned or beaten to death by cudgels, in front of the assembled troops, by his fellow soldiers or those whose lives had been put in danger. Soldiers under sentence of fustuarium who escaped were not pursued but lived under sentence of banishment from Rome. In the event that a group of legionaries are to be subjected to this punishment, the Tribune would make an alteration in order to spare the majority of the accused. The Tribune would first select a handful of the guilty men, and those selected would be condemned to the original penalty under the Fustuarium. The remainder of the accused would then be driven out of the camp and forced to live in an undefended location for a chosen period of time; they were also limited to eating only barley.</li>
            <li>Decimation – According to 17th century belief (possibly folk etymology, the Romans practiced this punishment in which a sentence was carried out against an entire unit that had mutinied, deserted, or shown dereliction of duty. One out of every ten men, chosen by lots, would be beaten to death, usually by the other nine with their bare hands, who would be forced to live outside the camp and in some instances obliged to renew the military oath, the sacramentum.</li>
