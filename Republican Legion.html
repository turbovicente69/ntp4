        <h2 class = "podnaslov">Birth and Death of a Republican Legion</h2>
        <p class = "justified">When we speak about the Roman Republic, we are roughly talking about the period from the 6th to the 1st century BC. In this era, Rome’s armies were essentially just citizen levies which is where they get their name of “Legions” (Latin : Legio, military levy). Procedurally, the way this worked is that only those with Imperium (supreme form of executive power in ancient Rome) could summon the levy, this basically meant the two annually elected Consuls. The process would begin when the chief magistrates called the meeting of the popular assembly, at which they would announce that all Roman citizens of military age would present themselves. This typically happened every year, just before the start of the campaigning season. On the appointed day, those liable for service would assemble by the capital. The officers and the men would be divided into four legions, two per consul, take an oath, and be given a date for the next rendezvous. At this following meeting, the men would be assigned to specific units within the legion, based on their wealth and age class, each of which was expected to show up with a specific type of gear. You had your Velites light skirmishers, Hastatii, Principes and Triarii heavy infantry and your mounted Equites, which roughly equated to 4200 men per legion. In some cases, the individual size of the legions and the number of the legions might be increased to deal with a particular crisis. These forces would then march to war. In addition to the purely Roman Legions, you’d also expect to have additional legions supplied by their Italian allies, joining the campaign. They were organized in a similar manner but raised according to their own cities practices.</p>

        <figcaption class = "fig">1. Velites; 2. Hastatii; 3. Principes; 4. Triarii</figcaption>
        <p class = "justified">Once Republican Legions were born, they would rally at a common mustering point and set off to war. In the early days, these efforts would usually only last a single campaigning season. Come winter, the levy army would have returned home and been disbanded. If the fighting had gone particularly badly or some natural disaster struck, they might not even return at all. Either way, if the army was called up again the following year, then the whole process of raising a legion would begin anew, thus what we have in this period is a cycle of birth, death and rebirth of the legions. As the centuries rolled by however, the scope of Roman warfare increased, with ever longer campaigns being fought over ever longer distances. One year terms of service, by the commander and his men were ill-suited for such activities. Exceptions were soon being made, to extend those tours of duty for multiple campaign seasons until it eventually became the norm. By the late Republican period, it was not uncommon for legions to serve multiple years abroad and for some commanders to find themselves being granted extended periods of Imperium.<br/> The number of legions and those with the power to command them was also increased. Eventually it also became standard practice to allow magistrates with Imperium to raise and organize armies themselves, which were funded by treasury grants, wealth extracted from the relevant province and personal funds. This streching of the norm was helpful in allowing the Roman military to carry on its war efforts against foreign threats, but would also pave the way for ambitious Roman politicians to co-opt the military for their own goals which eventually led to civil war. Suffice to say, the archaic system of the early republic, we initially described no longer applied to the birth and death of legions by the first and second century BC. The reforms of Marius, are a reflection of just one aspect of the evolution of the Roman army, which was now beggining to transition into a permanent professional force, rather than an annual levy.</p>

        <h2 class="podnaslov">Roman Polybian Legion and Triplex Acies</h2>
        <p class = "justified">Small bands of clan warriors gradually evolved into a Greek-like hoplite phalanx. But as the threats that the Romans faced, changed, so did their military.At the beginning of the 3rd century BC, Rome entered a series of wars with its Samnite neighbors and suffered some defeats. It is widely speculated that the army reformed once again during this time of crisis, and by the Pyrrhic War, the Manipular system was in place.This is the army which, ninety years later, would defeat Hannibal at Zama, and was commanded by some of the most notable figures in Roman history such as Scipio Africanus and Fabius Maximus.The Romans no longer used the single compact line formation like they had done in the past.Instead, they used the famous triplex acies, the triple line formation. Compared to the close order Phalanx of the earlier Roman state, the manipular system and triplex acies promoted utility and maneuverability around the battlefield. Individual maniples could be commanded tomove and reinforce a certain section quickly if required before the battle started. Insteadof forming up in three solid lines, the legions would use a quincunx, or checkerboard formation.The details of this are unclear in the sources, but it is likely that it increased flexibilityand allowed for retreats through the gaps between the maniples, which were around thesize of a maniple itself, which allowed the units to fit. In addition, because not allof the legionaries were engaged at the same time, there were reserves waiting for any potential surprise. The Roman lines engaged in combat did not fight in this formation however, and instead filled into a solid line, but the reserve lines remained in their quincunx until it was their turn to fight.<br/> In this period, the Roman legion was still not fully standardised and each of the three lines had a different quality. 1,200 Young Hastati manned the front ranks, 1,200 more experienced Principes were placed in the second with 600 veteran Triarii in the third. As a screening force, a Roman legion would also field a 1,200 strong force of lightly armed and armoured Velites to skirmish with the enemy before contact, as well as 300 cavalry. The Hastati would close with the enemy first,throwing their two Pila and then charging into the enemy. After a while, the tired Hastati would retreat behind the fresh Principes, who were then expected to win the battle.If this did not work also, both lines would retreat behind the veteran Triarii, and thearmy would either attempt to withdraw in good order, or would rely on the Triarii to win.This formation was able to operate in such a way due to the tactics used and also the equipment of the soldiers.<br/> The 1,200 Velite light infantry were lightly armoured with a patchwork of leather and fur. They notably wore a wolf’s head on top of their own, probably for recognition by their own troops. As for their weapons, they were armed with either five or seven light javelins or darts which they threw at the enemy line before the battle,in order to soften them up. When this was done, they had a gladius in reserve in order to engage in close combat if needed. For more protection, they also carried a light wooden shield called a parma. These light troops were the soldiers who would engage unconventional units such as war elephants or chariots if the Romans faced them, as their flexibility allowed them to perform better against them than the regular heavy infantry. After skirmishing,however, this light force would quickly retreat behind the line and wait for further orders.It is said that part of the reason Velites were placed at the front of the army was so that they could ideally challenge an enemy one against one, hopefully defeating him and gaining glory or promotion for himself. After falling back behind the line, some sources even state that the Velites would function as support troops and carry wounded soldiers to the rear, so they could receive medical attention.In the main infantry line, the Hastati and Principes were equipped in almost exactly the same way, but the more experienced soldiers may have had higher quality equipment. In contrast to the earlier thrusting spear of the phalanx, each soldier in the first two ranks carried one or two Pila: the Roman throwing javelin. This weapon, usually thrown en masse just before contact, consisted of a 4 foot wooden shaft, a thin 2 foot long iron shank and a pyramidal point. The weight was concentrated just behind the head, so the Pila had exceptional penetration power. It would often go straight through a shield and penetrate the flesh behind it, or just make the shield heavy and unwieldy. Once the Pila had been thrown, the Romans would draw their signature swords; the Gladius. This fearsome blade was copied from Iberia at some point in the mid republic and was mainly a short thrusting weapon, but could also devastate enemies with its slashing power. Only a few of these swords from the Republican period have been found, and were a bit bigger than their successors in the Empire.<br/> For defence,these early legionaries carried the large Scutum shield and had a range of body armour. The wealthiest soldiers could afford sophisticated mail cuirasses, while poorer soldiers might only have a square or circular slab of iron wrapped around their torso.In the third line were the 600 elite Triarii. In contrast with the Hastatii and Principes,these veteran soldiers were still armed as Phalanx style spearmen, and were armed with the traditional thrusting spear and round Clipei shield. These older troops were so revered that there was a Roman saying, that ‘It has come to the Triarii. This meant that the younger and less experienced soldiers had not managed to gain victory, so now the more experienced men were needed to step in and sort things out once and for all. At the Battle of the River Trebia in 218BC during the Second Punic War, the Triarii were the soldiers who stayed in formation and held the Carthaginians off while the majority of the other soldiers still alive ran away. Roman cavalry during this period has an undeservedly bad reputation, primarily due to their many crushing defeats, especially against Hannibal and his Numidians in the Second Punic War. In contrast to this impression, Roman cavalry was generally a highly efficient force which often gained victory even against higher numbers of enemy cavalry. The horsemen were primarily drawn from the two wealthiest classes in Roman society and most were required to serve. As explained earlier, each legion contained a contingent of 300 cavalry divided into ten squadrons of 30 men each. This seemingly small number was supplemented by the Roman allied cavalry, who provided a 900 strong cavalry force per legion, three times the amount the Romans provided.<br/> Their equipment also under went a change during this period. According to Polybius, lightly armoured horsemen with only undergarments were the main contingent. Throughout this period however, they became more heavily armoured in the Greek style with cuirasses, more sturdy lances and the Greek shield. The Greek hostage Polybius also noted that the willingness to see what others did better was one of the most admirable and deadly aspects of the Roman state. If they saw another people doing something in a superior manner, such as the use of a weapon or tactic, they often incorporated that style into their own methods in order to better themselves.In a standard consular army, two of these legionary formations existed, comprising around 9,000 men. On top of this, there were two contingents of both Roman allies and allied cavalry which usually matched or even exceeded the size of the legionary formations. Roman Consuls during this time appointed three prefects to command these allied troops. These allies,known as Socii, were essentially permanent, non-independent military allies of the Roman state and received many benefits in return for their loss of territory and independence.Each Socii remained domestically independent, were protected from their internal rivals and the Italian peninsula was protected from external invaders.<br/> Even though there were perks to it, many of the allies rebelled at every opportunity, especially their perennial Samnite enemies. Despite this, even in their darkest hour after the Battle of Cannae in 216BC, over half of the Socii population did not betray Rome.For the vast majority of its existence, the Roman armies of the mid-republican Polybian legion were at war. Whether it was the Samnites, Tarentines, Pyrrhus, Carthage, Macedon or the Seleucid Empire, the Polybian legion honed itself against the best that the world had to offer. The resulted in huge manpower strains, especially when losses such as Trasimene and Cannae cost tens of thousands of casualties in only days. Even victories such as Cynoscephalaecost thousands to the Romans. In return however, the war machine of the Roman state became a well-oiled mincing machine, capable of turning and obliterating the successor kingdoms of Alexander the great with barely any setbacks. In fact, many scholars have described the Roman army after the Punic Wars as one of the most battle-hardened forces ever to exist.It would only get better as time went on. The social impact of this war intensity onthe Roman political system should not be understated. Before the battle of Cannae, a property requirement existed to join the legions. After Cannae, desperation had reached a point where even the ban on criminals serving in the legions had to be lifted due to a need for manpower.This trend would continue and would eventually lead to the famous Marian reforms and the proletarianisation of the Roman Army.</p>

        <h2 class="podnaslov">Marian Reforms</h2>
        <p class = "justified">In the late second century BC, Rome had defeated and subjugated Greece and Macedonia, wiped Carthage from existence and had delivered the Seleucid Empire a devastating blow. Its fortunes seemed to be ever increasing, but problems were growing slowly. The stress of ever-increasing warfare and wealth division in their society was threatening to tear the Republic apart. On top of this, the militia army of the earlier republic was stagnating,and becoming inadequate for facing new enemies due to a lack of manpower. Soon a threat from the north would emerge that would necessitate the complete overhaul of the Roman military into what was essentially the first Roman Imperial Army. Welcome to our video on the Marian reforms of the late republic.In 113 BC, a roaming army of Germanic warriors crossed Rome’s border on the Danube, driven by unlivable climate conditions in their homeland. For the next few years they rampaged aroundRoman territory and defeated a few Roman armies. In 105BC they crushed an army of 80,000 legionaries at Arausio, after which the situation became critical.The Roman people were terrified, and expected the Germanic hordes at the gates of Rome atany time. It seemed as through the Republic might fall until one man returned to take command: Gaius Marius. He had just finished the Jugurthine War against the Numidians and was elected consul in absentia during the year 105 BC. Upon his return to Rome, he began to drastically alter the military in order to combat this new threat. His reforms would have a wide-ranging impact, both on the legions and the state of Rome.It is worth noting that not all of his changes were novel. Generals before Marius had paved the way for them, and had partaken in various different tactics before this time, such as the reduction of the baggage train. Marius, however, both created new methods for the Roman army, and permanently instituted the effective methods of the other commanders who had come before him. Until Marius’ reforms, there was a property requirement to join the citizen militia legions.<br/> This limited the number of legionaries, as they had to supply their own arms and armour and had to own property valued at 3,500 sesterces or more. Perhaps the most important reform implemented by Marius was to ignore this property requirement. He allowed the capite censi of Rome to join the legions: those ‘counted by the head’. The landless poor were now among the ranks of those who could join the legions, even though they had no property. On top of and because of this, Marius arranged for the state to supply the legions with their arms and armour, offered poor recruits the chance to gain a professional soldier’s pay and the chance to gain loot and plunder on campaign. The masses, with little hope of gaining status in any other occupation,flocked to Marius’ new legions. In contrast to the earlier Roman policy in which the citizen army would disband after a campaign, recruits were now enlisted for a term of 16 years.This created a standing Roman army for the first time and drastically increased its quality.On the other hand, the balanced cross-sectional army of the Roman people at war was destroyed,in favour of an army made up mainly of the landless poor, the proletarii. This would eventually have grave consequences for the republic, as the poor soldiers became loyal to their generals, rather than to the Roman state. While this seems like a landmark change,it is also possible that these reforms were just the final stage in an already occurring gradual decline in property requirements for the Roman army.The organisation of the various Roman units was also completely changed in these reforms.The early maniple system was last recorded being used in the Battle of Muthul in the Jugurthine War of 109 BC.<br/> As the system had become obsolete and needed replacement, the Romans did away with it without sentimentality. By 104 BC Marius had discarded four of the five legionary standards, which had been used for command and control purposes: the minotaur,horse, boar and wolf. Only one remained; the aquila, or eagle. This is when the Roman eagle standard became the emblem of the Roman legions.<br\> To replace the maniples as the primary tactical unit of the Roman military, the Cohort was adopted. Compared to the 120-strong maniple, a standard Republican Cohort was a larger 600-strong unit, comprising of 6 Centuries.480 of these men were legionaries, whereas the other 120 were non-combatants – either servants, slaves or tactical support personnel such as engineers.The component unit, the Roman ‘century’, was a 100 strong unit commanded by a Centurion.In this unit, 80 men served as legionaries and 20 men were non-combatants. There was no designated military commander of a Cohort itself, and it is widely believed that either the most senior Centurion took command, or the six Centurions commanded together as a council. The smallest and most personal unit in this system was the Contubernium. This was comprised of 10 men commanded by an officer called a Decanus. 8 men were legionaries and only 2 were non-combatants. Ten Contubernia made up a Century, and six Centuries made up a Cohort. It was ten of these new military divisions which made up a new Roman legion of around 6,000 men, with 4,800 legionaries and 1,200 noncombatants.The abolition of the manipular system also abolished the three distinct lines of infantry of the mid-republic. The Hastati, Principes and Triarii were removed and instead, three lines of infantry, equipped similarly to the earlier Principes, were adopted. The form of Triplex Acies used in the Marian legion was different to the one implemented prior to it.<br/> Cohorts were a solid unit with only small gaps between them, compared to the previous maniple system with larger gaps. This, along with the increased depth of the new cohorts,reduced the tendency of the soldiers to panic and flee, as they would feel they had more support and were safe. The legions were now on their way to becoming the force of popular imagination, a homogeneous force of heavy infantry armed with the Gladiusas their primary weapons and a dagger called the Pugio as a sidearm. These new uniform warriors were all named Legionarii. Their equipment mostly remained the same, but some tweaks were made. The iron shank of the Pilum javelin was previously attached to the wooden shaft by two nails. However Marius replaced one of the nails with a less sturdy wooden peg. On impact with a shield, the peg would snap, rendering the Pilum useless and bending the shank at a right-angle, making the enemy even more encumbered by the impaling of their shields. As for protection, the legionarii wore a helmet,body armour and greaves. His main protection however, was still the large Scutum shield,which covered the soldier from shoulder to shin. A legionary would also bash and batter opponents with his shield despite its weight. In this way, it could be just as offensive as his blade. The 1,200 non-combat attendants may seem like a lot of support personnel at first glance, but it is important to remember the key role of logistics in warfare. Without food, animals, fuel and maintenance, an army could not function.The reforms did not ignore logistics, and the creation of ‘Marius’ Mules’ was a perfect example of this. Under him, the legionaries began to carry all of their equipment themselves, rather than relying on a cumbersome baggage train. This had many positive impacts for the operations of the army. The soldiers themselves became conditioned by their heavy load, with the physical training increasing their endurance during combat. In addition,the soldiers carrying their own entrenching equipment allowed for the rapid construction of fortifications, camps and earthworks. Finally the lack of a massive baggage train also allowed the legions to move extremely quickly compared to their prior speed. The only drawbacks were the complaints from the legionaries about their new heavy workload – becoming referred to as Marius’ Mules, named so for their heavy packs.As the Republic progressed, the unpopular nature of horsemanship in Roman society resulted in a severe deficit of cavalry.<br/> While the Romans were still fighting smaller foes on their peninsula, the smaller cavalry wing they possessed was adequate. However, as they began to come into contact with larger external foes with fearsome cavalry contingents, such as the Germans or Gauls, it resulted in serious setbacks, despite their lethal heavy infantry. After the Battle of Zama, Roman armies were almost always accompanied by a significant force of non-Italian cavalry. This became even more pronounced in the time of Marius,as he disbanded most of the Roman and Italian cavalry, replacing it entirely with native allied cavalry, who were often better trained and had specialised equipment from their homeland.In his later conquest of Gaul, Julius Caesar relied heavily on the famous Numidian cavalry and later his Gallic and Germanic heavy cavalry for his victories in that war. Indeed, the final cavalry charge that gained victory at the Battle of Alesia in 52 BC was made by Caesar’s German cavalry. Allied light infantry Auxilia were also used in place of the earlier Velites, which Marius disbanded. Various native peoples from around and outside the Empire were used, including but not limited to German light infantry,Balearic slingers, Cretan archers and light Spanish melee troops.Using his newly honed legions and tactics, Marius was successful and the Cimbri were defeated once and for all at the Battles of Aquae Sextaie and Vercellae in 102 and 101BC. The reforms had their desired effect on the army, making it a standing professional force which did not disband after campaigning, allowing it to retain its experience. In the coming centuries, this would set the stage for the development of the most efficient and deadly army of the ancient world. Despite the benefits, 
        such massive changes would not go without consequence for the Republic. Because the general of a Roman army was responsible for the payment of their soldiers in both land and coin, the armies would often be more loyal to their general than to the Roman state. This was exacerbated as the majority of legionaries were now the poorer proletarii who desired payment and advancement. As a result, power began to shift from the senatorial class to the commanders in the field. From Marius,to Sulla, Pompey and finally to Caesar, this would cause a series of power struggles between various the strongmen of Rome which led to a series of civil wars.</p>
