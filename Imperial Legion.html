        <div id = "levi">
            <p>The empire lasted from the first to well beyond the 5th century AD with lots of changes we could potentially discuss but we will try and  
                 keep things simple and generalize our analysis. The biggest change in the empire was the centralization of power under the figure of the emperor. This had all really come together under the reign of Augustus following the turbulent civil wars of the late Republic. His first move was to demobilize the roughly 60 legions under his control and reform them into a new 28 legion strong standing army. Soldiers were now paid professional volunteers who initially served 16 and later 25 years before being rewarded with money and sometimes land upon retirement. Organizationally the legions now featured 10 cohorts 9 of which had 480 men and one, The First cohort boasting 800 men. Over the following years both the terms of service of the soldiers and their organization would gradually change but by en large remain mostly the same. Of course there were additional auxiliaries and other forces to speak of too but we will ignore these for the purposes of our discussion . Okay so how were these new legions born? Well it basically came down to the command of the emperor who held ultimate control over military forces. As we stated, Augustus has started off with 28 legions and this number would fluctuate over the years. Generally each legion would be stationed in a particular area and have its own designated recruitment ground. When a new legion was to be raised its enlistment took place en mass. This involved recruitment officers making the rounds of the cities and towns of the region. Prospective recruits would be put to the test, sworn in and then sent to their unit. However we should note that these armies were never entirely green. It was common practice to actually use detachments from existing legions to serve as a foundation for the new force and to transfer over officers with experience to train up the men in this way it could reach peak efficiency much more quickly. Once formed, these legions could go on to exist for many decades and even centuries. The Fourth Scythian legion for example was raised by Mark Anthony in 42BC and appears in our records as late as the end of the fourth century AD making it at least 400 years old or almost twice the age of the United States. Each passing year brought more experience and fostered a stronger espiricoach amongst the men which could survive the generations. This is best typified by the intense level of reverence given to the legionary standards which served as the embodiment of the unit. Their loss in battle could be a huge blow to the army and the recovery of such symbols was of great importance to the roman military. Okay so now that we have a permanent standing army how exactly does it die? Well one of the simplest answers is that it gets killed. This might happen following a major military defeat such as the loss of the 17th 18th and 19th legions at the battle of Teutoburg forest. However the total annihilation of forces was actually quite rare, even if it did happen the legion might simply be revived with its same traditions and symbols. What was more common was the gradual grinding down of forces. This might be caused by injury illness, retirement, desertion or the dispersal of forces to take on other duties. This concept is a very important one to understand for people used to hearing about legions numbering around 5000 men. In reality allegiance headcount was lower than this theoretical paper strength, how much lower depended on the situation. Looking back at the late republic for instance, Caesar conducted much of his civil war with legions at around 50% strength and sometimes even lower. The same degradation of forces could occur during the empire following prolonged periods of fighting or during periods where recruitment was too low. With enough attrition a legion would ultimately lose combat effectiveness and no longer be able to function as a proper force in this way the famous 14th legion The Conquerors of Britain slowly faded into obscurity until being relegated to the ignominity of serving as river patrolmen along the Danube in the 4th century AD. Another way for a legion to die would be for it to become merged with another force. This would often happen with the severely understrength legions we just mentioned whereby they could join an existing unit or be used to found a new legion. The process of merging units shows up in our records when you look at the kagnomin of legions bearing the word Gemina meaning twin. For example the 7th Gemini Legion was formed when the heavily damaged 7th Hispania Legion was combined by Vespasian in 70 AD with the 18th Legion and several cohorts from the Rhine. The last main way for a legion to die was for it to be disbanded. This might happen for a variety of reasons, one reason might be as a result of a military draw down following the conclusion of a campaign or during a period of economic contraction. In these cases the disbandment would be an honorable one, the soldiers would be paid out and settled down or perhaps transferred to another unit. Often this process of disbandment involves settling the veterans in a military colony which would traditionally bear their name. All legions however settled down so peacefully it was not unheard of for legions to rise up and revolt or merely choose the wrong side in a civil war. In the aftermath some of these legions might be put down as punishment for their behavior.</p>

        <h2 id = "podnaslovi">Roman Army during the Crisis of the Third Century</h2>
         <p class = "justified" id = "para">During the late second century, it was clear that the needs of Rome’s military were rapidly beginning to change, and a shifting strategic situation would soon make adaptation essential. The 100s AD had been a time of peace and plenty in the Roman Empire – a golden age which Edward Gibbon described as the happiest time in human history. However, upon the death of Emperor Commodus in 192, the Empire began a spiraling decline which would last almost an entire century, helped along by increasing external threats along its eastern and northern borders, rampant disease, and internecine civil war. The Roman army had to come to terms with these conditions, and, despite suffering greatly along the way, managed to do just that, and arguably became even stronger than before out of necessity. When Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus assumed the Roman throne in 161, there were 29 legions in the army. This figure was almost immediately reduced to 28 when one of the legions, possibly legio IX Hispana, was destroyed in a war with the Parthians. It was not until 165 that Marcus Aurelius created the new, legions II and III ‘Italica’, in order to face the Marcomanni and their allies on the Rhine-Danube frontier. Legionary recruitment had been drastically changed since the Republic and Early Empire, so let us delve into a bit of detail about how middle-imperial legionary enrolment took place. When were men brought into the Imperial legions during this time, it was done so primarily through conscription, but a good number of troops still enrolled voluntarily with expectations of good pay and potential advancement to a rank which was both profitable and prestigious? Legions I and III ‘Parthica’, raised by Septimius Severus, for example, were recruited primarily by conscripting the defeated Roman units of his civil war opponent, Pescennius Niger in 194.This recruitment process as a whole was known as the dilectus, or ‘levy’ in our terms, and Herodian’s description of Caracalla’s visit to Alexandria in 215AD gives us some idea about how a dilectus might have been conducted. An edict was issued by the Emperor stating that all of Alexandria’s young men should assemble on an open area of ground,probably in a similar landscape in spirit to the Field of Mars, or campus martius in Rome. Caracalla wished to create a phalanx in honour of Alexander – whom he was obsessed with. The young would-be phalangites were made to muster in ordered ranks so that the emperor could examine each man, judging if their stature, age and condition measured up to the army’s standard or not. It’s worth noting that this occasion was not exactly a routine muster of Roman legionaries and so it could be anoutlier. However, it is an example of how an experienced Roman commander and emperor- Caracalla – was used to rallying troops for military purposes. The army usually favoured men from agricultural backgrounds, rather than urbanites like the Alexandrians or those in Rome itself, mainly because such recruits were accustomed to hard work and tough conditions. We can sense from some of the surviving sources and physical evidence that there seems to have been a sort of classism in imperial society about membership of different parts of the Roman army. For example, the gravestone of a praetorian centurion proclaimed that he had ‘faithfully commanded a century in a praetorian cohort, not in a barbarian legion’. Naturally, this figure seems to have thought himself far too good for the mere rabble of brutish farmers. The ‘barbarian legions’, made up of provincials had the last laugh however, as Septimius Severus disbanded the praetorians in 193 and reformed them purely from the ranks of ordinary legionaries. The characteristics and bearing of the primarily rural, increasingly provincial and ‘culturally backwards’ legionaries often shocked the more sophisticated segments of Roman society, such as the famous senator Cassius Dio. He was familiar with the relatively soft and cultured praetorians, reporting that the Pannonian soldiers who entered Rome with Severus in 193 were ‘most savage in appearance, most terrifying in speech and most boorish in conversation’. Evidence from even more Roman gravestones suggests that most legionaries enlisted were between the ages of 17 to 23, though it wasn’t uncommon for older or younger recruits to join up. It’s quite easy for us to picture a particularly large 15 year old from Egypt going down to the recruiting station thinking of adventure. Being ‘big’ in those days isn’t the same as how we think of it, however. Vegetius states that the ideal height of a soldier was 5 feet and 9 inches – 1.77 metres, and that soldiers of the first cohort of a legion should be at least 5 feet and 7 inches- 1.72 metres. This first cohort was often the elite formation of the legion, so the increased height requirement can’t have hurt in an age of melee combat with swords and other close quarters weapons. After Septimius Severus came to power, discharge became an annual occurrence among the legionaries, who henceforth served for a fixed period of 26 years. However, the Third Century Crisis and its intermittent civil wars messed all of that up. From around 244 or thereabouts, a 40-year period of more or less constant foreign war and internal strife began, which resulted in soldiers being kept in service far beyond their regular term. Much later, in the reign of Emperor Aurelian from 270 to 275, we find a soldier named Aurelius Iulianus who had served in Legio II Parthica for 33 years. Naturally, some troops were more than happy to continue serving their empire, but only if they were adequately compensated for doing so. Pay was, is and will always be crucial for maintaining armies, and during the turbulent period of Rome’s middle-empire, it became essential. This mercenary attitude was personified by the soldier-emperor Septimius Severus, who advised his sons upon his deathbed to be harmonious, enrich the soldiers and scorn all other men.’During his life, this ruler had presided over the first pay increase for Roman legionaries for over a century. 100 years before, Domitian had increased military pay to an annual sum of 300 silver denarii paid in 4 separate installments. Low-level officers were granted that pay and another half on top of it, while senior officers received double. Severus increased the soldiers’pay by around 50%, making the basic wage 450 denarii, pay which was often supplemented by so-called ‘donatives’ – special gifts from the emperor on celebratory occasions or when he felt like sharing booty after a campaign. After Severus’ death, Caracalla doubled the pay again to 900 denarii, but that was a step too far and it placed a massive strain on imperial finances. Pay rises turned out to be an even bigger problem and when his successors tried to return army wages to more reasonable levels, it caused unrest and mutiny. This restraint didn’t last long. When Maximinus Thrax – the ‘big guy from Thrace’ as Professor Gregory Aldrete called him – came to the throne in 235, he AGAIN doubled the soldiers’ pay to 1,800 denarii. It’s worth noting that the third century saw massive inflation, so increasing pay by such ridiculous degrees might not have been as indulgent as it seems. The legionary infantry’s tactical command structure remained relatively unchanged throughout the turbulent third century, with its cohorts, centuries and contubernia units. However, there were a few differences in command and composition which were gradually starting to appear, and that need to be outlined. Legionary high command gradually changed throughout the third century, perhaps due to the ‘barrack emperors’ and their distrust of the senatorial class in Rome. Until around 260, most legions were still commanded by a senatorial officer known as a legatus. Even early on though, some legions, such as legio II Traiana, based near Alexandria in Egypt, were commanded bya praefectus or ‘prefect’ – a former legionary Primus Pilus who had been promoted to the equestrian order. The Emperors might have looked at Egypt’s undeniably protected status, with senators being banned from going there and its politics being almost totally restrained. So, at some point between 260 and 268, Emperor Gallienus finally issued an edict prohibiting senators from military commands entirely, and by the Third Century’s end all legions were led by professional prefects.Next we must outline how the soldier-emperors began to deal with the increasing levels of pressure on Roman borders by changing how Roman armies operated around the empire on a fundamental level, and how they were deployed. From around the time of Marcus Aurelius, the deployment of entire legions to specific battlefields was gradually toned down, and by the mid third century, it was incredibly rare for a full legion to leave its base and fight abroad. For the entirety of Lucius Verus’ Parthian War, the men of legio I Minerva, legio II Aduitrix and legio V Macedonica served in the east in their whole capacity. However, in the empire’s subsequent wars on its northern border from 168 to 180, many legions were deployed not as whole units, but in sliced up detachments known as vexillationes- so-called because they would march under a banner known as a ‘vexillum’, or ‘vexilla’ in the plural. When referring to this type of unit, vexillationes were not bound by any kind of specific size like, for example, a cohort was, and could designate a unit split from a larger legion of any size. Already in 170AD, Marcus Aurelius’ recently established legions II and III Italica were operating in vexillationes, and this trend only increased in frequency as the years went on. An inscription from the city of Solinin modern Croatia records how vexillationes from legio II Pia and legio III Concordia were combined and fought together to protect the city from barbarian invasions during the Marcomannic Wars. From this point on, the ‘legion’ as a unit began its transition from a mobile army in itself to a kind of static reserve which was stationed at a particular location. From that base, it would detach vexillationes as needed for garrison duties or service in larger field armies. The employment of this ‘static’ default system would also allow completion of other duties without compromising its primarily role of frontier defence and provincial law enforcement – two roles which were becoming increasingly important as the empire calcified and went on the defensive. The advances of this system were practical in nature, despite the initial appearance of weakening individual legions. More mobile Vexillationes could be moved around the empire far quicker than the larger legionary formations, and could therefore more quickly respond to faraway threats. Moreover, because of their smaller size, they were more easily supplied during their long marches to where they were needed, placing less of a strain on the empire’s logistics and populations on the army’s line of march. When many of these smaller formations were massed together into a field army, they were capable of destroying the larger militaries Rome often faced, such as the Persian armies fielded by the well-organised Sassanid Empire. However, when needed, they could also be detached and dispersed to combat less numerous opponents. In essence, they were a strategically flexible tactical unit, compared to the massive administrative unit which the legion had been. As a standard, a combat vexillation usually was comprised of one or two cohorts – 600 to 1,200 men – who retained their centurial tactical organisation, and would fight in this manner in the field. This meant that these units were essentially mini-legions carrying the number and names of the parent legion. While the arrangement was usually intended to be temporary, the ravages and turmoil of the third century made it virtually certain that some vexillationes would essentially become estranged from their parent legions, having been detached for so long. Equipment in the Roman army, which had been so typically uniform for centuries, began to diversify beginning in the mid-second century, with such notable weapons as the gladius no longer being seen as catch-all pieces of gear. Imperial infantry for the most part stopped using short-swords and instead adopted medium and long blades, though it should be noted that some short swords remained in use. Some of the longest Roman swords from this time are so large as to resemble the heavy rapiers of the early-modern period. However, this change in weaponry doesn’t seem to have affected Roman swordsmanship doctrine too much, and there is no evidence that primary weapon usage switched to slashing rather than thrusting. Vegetius still advocates the use of a sword’s point in combat rather than its edge in his account of legionary training, and Ammianus Marcellinus confirms the assertion when he states that legionaries used their swords to ‘thrust’ at a battle much later, indicating a continuity of practice in the middle empire. Many modern scholars have referred to the aforementioned longer-blades as spatha, but Ammianus refers to them as the gladius, which could just be a colloquial term at this point for a ‘roman sword’ whatever its design. Other weapons, such as the pugio dagger and the pilum seem to have remained relatively standard in frontline soldiers. It seems like the Romans also discovered that additional armour was, in fact, good during the middle-empire, and because of that began producing heavier defensive equipment. Ringmail shirts commonly began to consist of full-length sleeves down a soldiers’ arms and could even extend far down the thighs, while scale cuirasses were reinforced with chest plates. Use of the famous legionary lorica segmentata armour, consisting of iron plates and hoops was limited, but it continued until at least the middle of the third century. To supplement its relatively low level of limb protection, articulated arm guards known as manicae were used, in addition to greaves and even thigh guards. Helmets also became heavier and more protective during these years, with the Imperial Italic series of helmets ceasing production by the early third century. All legionaries subsequently adopted heavier pieces of headgear of single-bowl construction, reinforced by cross-pieces and with very deep napes, leaving only a small t-shaped opening for the face. This type of helmet offered excellent protection for the vulnerable head and neck, but the cheek pieces would obscure peripheral vision and the lack of ear-holes would make listening difficult. They remained dominant until the close of the third century, when they were replaced with Sassanid-style ridge-helmets and spagenhelms. They were of a poorer quality when compared to earlier models, but this kind of ‘austerity’ measure was necessary after the disasters of the third century.</p>
